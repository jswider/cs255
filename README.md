The Driverpass project involved designing a system for the a company who wanted to sell driving lessons.  They wanted to be able to sell different packages and arrange appointments with their clients.  I think one aspect of the system I did particularly well with was in capturing the big picture of what the company wanted out of their system, however one area I could have improved on was the class diagram that I made to represent the system.  I think I could have done better to represent the different aspects of the web portal as classes.  At every stage of designing the system I made sure to keep the user's needs in mind, for example it was never specifically requested by driverpass but it makes sense that users will occasionally wish to update their contact information so I made sure that was a feature that I included.  It's important to consider things like this when designing a system because by anticipating user needs you can make the system more intuitive and easy to use. I learned a lot about designing software in this course, I think it was very helpful to start by thinking about all the requirements of the system then moving from there to figuring out how to implement those requirements, that's something I'll definitely take with me in the future.
